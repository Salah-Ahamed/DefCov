# Covid_project

This project is a web application and mobile application  that saves user profiles and detect covid-19.this can be used as pre-screen tool before taking a PCR test.
The user has to record six type of sounds such as follows:

Shallow cough,
Shallow breathn
heavy cough,
vowel E ,
vowel O,
fast counting(from 1 to 10)

These sounds are inserted into deep learning models for each type.The 6  models that are used is a  type of Convolutional neural Network.This acts as a classifier and predicts if the user is covid positive and displays it to the user.

This system's models are stored as compressed files in the google drive (they are inside the model folder once it is uncompressed)
